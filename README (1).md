# SWAGLABS MobileApp
This project is my practice in Test Automation in MobileApp using Appium ..

SWAGLABS is a Simple E-commerce app with basic functions such as :

- login | add products to cart | show product detailes Etc ...

 







## I Tested 5 test cases With different functionality :

 - Login with a Valid Email and password.
 - Login with an invalid email or password.
 - Add Any Item to the cart.
 - Removing Items from the cart.
 - Online Ordering and complete the flow.



 ## I also Validate that :
 - login is performed successfully.
 - Title and price of the Item on the Home page equals the item and price at the cart.
 - validate that the cart is empty when I remove items from the cart.
 - Validate the price and success of purchase (End To End).
